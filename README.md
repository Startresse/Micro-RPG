# Micro-RPG

## Project

This project is a console auto play RPG.
I try to use cpp concepts I'm not used to use so that I can improve as a dev.

## Licence

You can use it as you feel as long as it's for personnal/non commercial use.
Please contact me if you're interested in any way with this project (my email is in my github profile).
